- **Mitigation**:
  - Regular load testing throughout development
  - Performance benchmarks at each phase
  - Horizontal scaling architecture design
  - Performance monitoring and alerting

#### **Medium Risk: Security Vulnerabilities**
- **Risk**: Healthcare data security breaches
- **Impact**: Compliance violations, legal issues, reputation damage
- **Probability**: 60% | **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Security reviews at each development phase
  - Automated security scanning in CI/CD
  - Regular penetration testing
  - Security specialist involvement in critical phases

### **Timeline Risks**

#### **High Risk: Dependency Delays**
- **Risk**: Dependencies between teams causing cascading delays
- **Impact**: Overall project timeline extension
- **Probability**: 70% | **Impact**: High
- **Mitigation**:
  - Clear API contracts defined early
  - Parallel development with mock services
  - Regular cross-team synchronization meetings
  - Buffer time in critical path activities

#### **Medium Risk: Scope Creep**
- **Risk**: Additional feature requests during development
- **Impact**: Timeline delays, budget overruns
- **Probability**: 40% | **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Strict change management process
  - Feature prioritization framework
  - Regular stakeholder alignment meetings
  - Change request approval workflow

### **Resource Risks**

#### **Medium Risk: Key Personnel Unavailability**
- **Risk**: Loss of critical team members
- **Impact**: Knowledge loss, development delays
- **Probability**: 30% | **Impact**: Medium
- **Mitigation**:
  - Comprehensive documentation requirements
  - Knowledge sharing sessions
  - Cross-training between team members
  - Backup resource identification
